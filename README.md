# MovieApp-proj
A Level CS Project (Python)

A project created for my A Level Computer Science coursework.
Coding in Python using Tkinter and an OMDB API (Open Movie Database API) I created an application where you can:
  - create your own account
  - find information about movies, both current and old
  - rate movies
  - add friends and share ratings
  - get recommendations from based on your ratings

To run the application:
  - MovieApp\dist\MovieApp.exe
